# ðŸ§˜ Mindful Yoga App - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

### Vision
Create a minimalist yoga practice app that feels like having a supportive friend guide you through yoga, not a demanding instructor or overwhelming library.

### Philosophy
"Breathe First, Features Later" - Every interaction should feel as natural and calming as taking a deep breath.

- **Abstract, calming visuals**: No intimidating perfect bodies
- **Flexible coaching**: Multiple voice personalities
- **Smart simplicity**: Features hidden until needed
- **Respectful approach**: English-first with optional Sanskrit

### Target Audience
- Primary: Personal use and friends
- Users: Both beginners and experienced practitioners
- Age: 25-45 years old
- Context: Home practice, office breaks, travel

## Mobile-First Design Principles

### Core Principles
- **Mobile baseline**: 375px minimum viewport (iPhone SE)
- **Touch-first interactions**: All interactions optimized for touch
- **No horizontal scrolling**: Content constrained to viewport width
- **Fixed layout system**: Header/content/footer structure
- **Safe area support**: iOS notch and home indicator handling

### Interaction Patterns
- **Tap to select**: Primary interaction method (no drag-and-drop)
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Fixed vs scrollable**: Clear separation of fixed UI and scrollable content
- **Bottom actions**: Primary CTAs in fixed footer for thumb reach

### Layout Specifications
- **Fixed header**: Navigation, timers, status (when needed)
- **Scrollable content**: Main interaction area with safe padding
- **Fixed footer**: Primary actions and controls
- **Viewport range**: Optimized for 375px-428px

### AppLayout Component âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Consistent structure**: Header/content/footer across all screens
- **Fixed positioning**: Header and footer remain stable during scroll
- **Safe area handling**: Automatic padding for iOS devices using `env(safe-area-inset-*)`
- **Content overflow**: Only main content area scrolls
- **Flexible configuration**: Optional header/footer per screen needs
- **Responsive padding**: Automatic adjustment for different screen sizes
- **Touch-optimized**: Footer actions positioned for thumb reach
- **Performance**: Minimal re-renders with stable layout structure

**Key Benefits Achieved**:
- Eliminates layout shift during navigation
- Prevents content from being hidden behind iOS UI elements
- Provides consistent interaction patterns across all screens
- Optimizes touch targets for mobile use
- Reduces cognitive load with predictable layout structure
